Greeting



I have successfully scraped laptop data from the Smartprix website using the Python Selenium library. In this repository, there are some key files:

**Scripting-** 
****
This file contains the Python script (scraper.py) responsible for navigating the Smartprix website using Selenium. 
It extracts essential information about laptops and organizes the data for further analysis.
 
**Save HTML** 
****
The HTML file (smartprix_page.html) stores the raw page source after the scraping process. 
It serves as a snapshot of the data extraction, capturing the state of the website during the scraping operation.

**Data Extraction (Data_Extraction.ipynb)**
****
In the Jupyter Notebook (Data_Extraction.ipynb), I utilize the BeautifulSoup (BS4) library for extracting relevant laptop details from the HTML.
This notebook provides insights into parsing techniques and data extraction methodologies.

**We can use these notebooks and CSV files for data cleaning and ML perspectives**.
****
The repository includes a navigation script (scraper.py), an HTML snapshot (smartprix_page.html), 
and a Jupyter Notebook (Extract data from html.ipynb) demonstrating data extraction with BeautifulSoup. 
These resources are valuable for beginners to perform EDA and ML algorithms.

I have upload this Data in **Kaggle** PFB the link:
